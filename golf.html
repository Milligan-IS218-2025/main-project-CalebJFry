            <h2>The Rules of Golf</h2>
            <p>
                Golf is a sport with a set of rules designed to ensure fairness, consistency, and safety for players.
                The basic objective is to hit a ball from the teeing ground into the hole on the green in as few strokes
                as possible. The game is typically played on an 18-hole course, where each hole has a designated par
                (the number of strokes an expert golfer is expected to take). Players use various clubs to strike the
                ball, each designed for different types of shots, from long drives to short chips. Key rules include
                staying within the boundaries of the course, not taking more than the allowed number of strokes on each
                hole (in stroke play), and adhering to course-specific conditions, such as hazards (water or sand traps)
                and obstacles (trees or rocks). Penalties are imposed for rule violations, such as hitting the ball out
                of bounds, grounding the club in a hazard, or taking an improper drop. The sport also places importance
                on the principles of sportsmanship and etiquette, such as respecting fellow players' shots and
                maintaining pace of play.
