            <h2>Swimming Legally</h2>
            <p>In competitive swimming, strict rules ensure fairness and consistency across all races. Each
                stroke—freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly—has specific technique requirements, such as
                arm movements, body position, and kick style, which must be followed throughout the race. Swimmers must
                start from the correct position on the block or in the water, depending on the event, and false starts
                (leaving before the signal) can lead to disqualification. Turns and finishes must also follow precise
                rules; for example, swimmers must touch the wall with both hands in breaststroke and butterfly. Swimmers
                must remain in their designated lanes and are not allowed to interfere with competitors. Officials
                closely monitor races to enforce these rules and ensure fair competition at all levels.</p>
