                <p>Welcome! This is a website about the main sports that I enjoy playing. My favorite sport is
                    swimming—obviously. I have been a competitive swimmer since I was four years old and have
                    never really taken a break from it. What started as simple lessons in the shallow end quickly
                    turned into a passion that has shaped much of who I am today. Swimming has taught me a lot about
                    hard work and what it means to stay committed to something over the long term. It’s not just a
                    sport to me—it’s a lifestyle. <br>

                    Being in the water has always felt natural and calming, but competitive swimming brought out a
                    different side of me. The early morning practices, the strict training schedules, and the constant
                    push to beat my personal best have all demanded serious dedication and mental toughness. Through
                    swimming, I’ve learned how to set goals, persevere through setbacks, and celebrate the small
                    victories along the way. It’s taught me the value of consistency and how progress often comes
                    slowly, but surely, through effort and patience.<br>

                    Beyond the physical and mental challenges, swimming has also helped me build important
                    relationships. I’ve met teammates who have become close friends, coaches who have mentored and
                    motivated me, and competitors who have inspired me to push harder. There's something special about
                    the swim community—whether we’re cheering each other on at a meet or pushing through a grueling set
                    together, there’s a shared respect and understanding that comes from spending hours in the pool.<br>

                    I’ve also learned how to manage my time effectively, balancing schoolwork, training, and social
                    life. These skills have carried over into other areas of my life and continue to help me grow as a
                    student and as a person. Swimming has given me structure, purpose, and confidence, and I genuinely
                    believe that many of the lessons I’ve learned in the pool will stay with me for the rest of my life.<br>

                    On this website, I’ll also talk about a few other sports I enjoy playing when I’m not swimming.
                    While swimming will always be my number one, trying different sports has helped me stay active, have
                    fun, and learn new skills. I hope you enjoy exploring my site and learning more about the sports
                    that have played such a big role in my life!
